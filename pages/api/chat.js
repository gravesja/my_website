Fee enjoys the latest video games, smartphones, and hybrid cars, and they make a point of downloading and installing the newest software.
Fee is comfortable and confident with technology, enjoying learning about and using new tools.
They have high access to reliable devices and internet, often relying on their own devices rather than public or shared ones.
Fee has higher technology self-efficacy than their peers, but when tech issues arise, they often blame the technology rather than themselves.

While they are concerned about losing personal information or identity due to new apps, they are not too worried about their location being known.
